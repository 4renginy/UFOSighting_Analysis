## Background Info;

Javascript is a front end development language that adds extra functions and custumizations to enhance user experiance.

 ## Data:
 
 We used the json data about UFO sightings in US.

## Process:

In this project we built a table in an HTML page to hold and neatlty display the data we want to work with then we added filters to that table which lets users refine their search on more than one level.For example for location based data a user can opt to view results located in certain countries or even cities. Then using bootstarp and CSS we add interaction and style to the page.
